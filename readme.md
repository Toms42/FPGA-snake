# Snake game
## Hardware setup:
This game was written for a cyclone V on a Terasic DE0-cv development board, but could easily be ported to other hardware.

Clock speed is set at 50MHz

It is supposed to use an SNES controller plugged into on of the breakout boards I made for the DE0-cv.

#### VGA specs:
This was written for a 4bit per color VGA dac, with 640x480 resolution.

##Details:
This is a work in progress. I'll add more stuff when it's done.
